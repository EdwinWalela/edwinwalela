My journey into Web development began with Javascript and It's a choice I am quite proud of. At the time, I wasn't fully aware of its capabilities. Every once in a while I marvel at the endless possibilities  it has to offer. 

### Goal

Learning by doing.

Writing software that people (or myself) get to use is something I live for. I recently discovered that helping others do the same is something I enjoy too. My goal is to share the knowledge I've acquired, engage with and inspire other developers to do the same.

Articles will feature writing, testing and deploying server-side applications using NodeJS. Some of the areas I'll cover include web crawling, sockets, Discord bots and database hosting among others.

### Why Javascript?

As a developer, one needs to be *Language Agnostic*. There isn't a 'superior' or 'inferior' programming language. I've decided to base the articles on Javascript since it's the language I am most comfortable with. The projects which will be featured can be as easily implemented using any programming language.

### Target Audience

Learning the fundamentals of a language before diving into projects is the best way to avoid frustrations when debugging code. The first article will feature a Javascript crash-course which I believe will be a good way to kick off this journey. Therefore, anyone with prior programming experience in any other language will be able to follow along.

The crash-course will only cover the basics of the language. As we progress through different projects, you will get to learn more.

> Some ideas may seem impossible but one day they will feel inevitable.
