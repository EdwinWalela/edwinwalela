```
console.log("hello world")
```

My journey into Web development began with Javascript and It's a choice I am quite proud of. At the time, I wasn't fully aware of its capabilites. Every once in a while I marvel at the endless possiblities it has to offer.

### Why Javascript?

As a developer, one needs to be *Language Agnostic*. There isn't a 'superior' or 'inferior' programming language. I decided to base the articles on Javascript since it's the language I am most comfortable with. The tutorials and projects which will be featured can be as easily implemented using any programming language.

### Goal

Learning by doing.

Writing software that people (or myself) get to use is something I live for. I recently discoverd that helping others do the same is something I enjoy too. My goal is to share the knowledge I've acquired, engage with and inspire other developers to do the same.


### Target Audience

Learning the fundamentals of a language before diving into projects is the best way to avoid the frustrations of debugging code. The first post will feature a crash-course which I believe will be a good way to kick off this journey. Therefore, anyone with prior programming experience in any other language will be able to follow along.

The crash-course will only cover the basics of the language. As we progress through different projects, you will get to learn more.




#### Buckle up, the journey is about to start...
